# CI/CD Pipeline Setup with AWS Services
### By Tushar Gupta

## Objective:
The goal is to set up a CI/CD pipeline that automates the deployment of a simple web application to a server. The pipeline should trigger on code pushes to a repository and deploy the application in a scalable manner. When load increases, the number of servers should automatically scale up or down, ensuring that new servers have the latest code.
